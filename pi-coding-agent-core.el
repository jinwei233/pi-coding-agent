;;; Commentary:

;; Core functionality for pi-coding-agent: JSON parsing, line buffering, RPC communication.
;; This module provides the low-level plumbing for communicating with the
;; pi coding agent via JSON-over-stdio.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'json)

;;;; JSON Parsing

(defun pi-coding-agent--parse-json-line (line)
  "Parse LINE as JSON, returning a plist.
Returns nil if LINE is not valid JSON."
  (condition-case nil
      (json-parse-string line :object-type 'plist)
    (json-error nil)))

;;;; Line Accumulation

(defun pi-coding-agent--line-chunks-string (chunks)
  "Return CHUNKS, stored newest first, as one string."
  (if chunks
      (apply #'concat (nreverse (copy-sequence chunks)))
    ""))

(defun pi-coding-agent--accumulate-line-chunks (chunks chunk)
  "Accumulate CHUNK into partial line CHUNKS.
CHUNKS stores fragments for an unfinished line newest first.  Return a cons
cell whose car is COMPLETE-LINES and cdr is REMAINDER-CHUNKS.  COMPLETE-LINES
are newline-terminated lines without newlines, and REMAINDER-CHUNKS is the
unfinished line state to keep for the next `process-filter' call.

The important property is that an unfinished long JSON line is kept as chunks
and materialized only when its newline arrives.  Large `get_messages' RPC
responses are one huge JSON line, so repeatedly concatenating the partial line
would otherwise become allocation-heavy and effectively quadratic."
  ;; Note: Empty strings are filtered here because they're not valid JSON.
  ;; This couples line splitting with JSON semantics, but keeps the API simple.

`pi-coding-agent--accumulate-line-chunks' directly so very large partial lines

;;; pi-coding-agent-gui-tests.el --- GUI integration tests for pi-coding-agent -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; ERT tests that require a real Emacs GUI (windows, frames, scrolling).
;; Run with: make test-gui [SELECTOR=pattern]
;;
;; These tests focus on behavior that CANNOT be tested with unit tests:
;; - Real window scrolling during streamed updates in a displayed buffer
;; - Auto-scroll vs scroll-preservation with deterministic fake scenarios
;; - Tool-block overlays and extension UI behavior through the subprocess seam
;;
;; Many behaviors (history, spacing, and linked-buffer teardown) are covered
;; more directly by unit tests.
;;
;; For quick fake-backed debugging with a visible window:
;;   ./test/run-gui-tests.sh pi-coding-agent-gui-test-scroll-auto-when-at-end
